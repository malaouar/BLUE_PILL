# BLUE_PILL


You want to bring the power of an ARM CORTEX-M3 into your projects for almost FREE ?!

BLUE PILL is a very cheap minimal dev board for the STM32F103C8 chip.

In this repo I share my experimets while playing with this board.

In files "get_started.doc" and "notes.txt" you find my notes from various places on the web.

The file "STM32F103_DEFINITIVE_GUIDE_TO_PINS_ALTERNATE_FUNCTIONS-V1.doc" is a work in progress.

I used YAGARTO as the toolchain under WIN7 and the STM32DUINO usb bootloader with DFU-util.exe to load programs in the chip.

DONE:
- HSI, HSE, PLL 72MHz
- Systick timer
- PWM
- SPI
- Interrupts
- DMA
- USART

TO DO:
- ADC
- USB
- I2C, CAN
- ...
